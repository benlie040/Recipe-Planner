# Recipe Planner

React application which helps you to plan your meals for every week by selecting a variety of recipes. I started this project to learn React & Typescript.

## Technologies Used
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [MUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/)

## How to run the client

- go into the folder client
- execute the command `npm install`
- if that was a success then run the command `npm run dev`
- enter in a browser the url `http://localhost:5173/` or in the terminal click on the link with `ctrl + click`

## Project status

The project is on hold. At the moment I'm learning GO, which I want to use to create the backend.
